Real-Life Example
Think of a restaurant:

Blocking: A waiter takes an order and waits at the kitchen until the dish is ready. 
          No other customers get served in the meantime.

Non-Blocking: The waiter takes an order, passes it to the kitchen, and continues taking 
              other orders. Once the food is ready, they serve it.


---------- worker threads analogy ------------------
In the **restaurant analogy**, **worker threads** are like **kitchen assistants/junior chefs** who handle heavy tasks in the background.

### **Without Worker Threads (Single-Threaded)**
Imagine a restaurant where there’s only **one chef**, and they must do everything:
- Taking orders
- Cooking food
- Washing dishes

If a customer orders a **complex dish** (like slow-roasted meat), the chef gets **stuck** working on it, 
and **other customers must wait** before their orders are even started. This is how **CPU-intensive tasks** block the Node.js event loop.

### **With Worker Threads (Multi-Threading)**
Now, imagine the chef has **kitchen assistants** (worker threads):
- The chef takes the orders and hands **complex dishes** to assistants.
- While assistants handle **slow-cooking meals**, the chef is **free to take new orders** and prepare faster dishes.
- When a slow-cooked meal is **ready**, the assistant hands it back, and the chef serves it.

### **How This Works in Node.js**
- **Worker threads** handle **CPU-heavy** tasks **without blocking** the main thread.
- The **main event loop** stays **free to handle requests**, making the server **faster and more responsive**.
- Common worker thread use cases include **image processing, cryptography, machine learning, and complex computations**.

So, worker threads allow **Node.js to multitask** efficiently—just like kitchen assistants helping a busy chef.
