1. JavaScript was designed as a client-side scripting language, mainly used within web browsers to enhance interactivity. 
   It was executed within the browser’s JavaScript engine—like SpiderMonkey in Firefox, V8 in Chrome, and others.

2. Later, the V8 engine, developed by Google, was wrapped inside Node.js, enabling JavaScript to run outside the 
   browser on the server-side. This allowed developers to build backend applications, handle databases, and 
   create full-stack solutions using JavaScript.
