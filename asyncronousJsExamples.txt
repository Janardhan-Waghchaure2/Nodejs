let a = 1;
let b = 2;

setTimeout(
    () => {console.log("value of a : " + a)}
    , 10
);

a = 10;

// for above code its exepected that output should be "value of a : 1" but it print 
"value of a : 10" because it executes asynchronously hence a = 10 will be executed 
before printing setTimeout callback.
